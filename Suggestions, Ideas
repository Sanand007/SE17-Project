Handwriting Recognition System- Train a machine learning algorithm to convert any handwritten text into computerized text.


Users

Students- To convert any handwritten notes and use it for reading or storing. (Text takes much less space than scanned images)

TA/Prof- Assist in garding handwritten papers of student.



Dataset for training the algorithm- 
MNIST Dataset- url-http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
