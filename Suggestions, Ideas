Ideas

Handwriting Recognition System- Train a machine learning algorithm to convert any handwritten text into computerized text.
Users
-Students- To convert any handwritten notes and use it for reading or storing. (Text takes much less space than scanned images)
-TA/Prof- Assist in garding handwritten papers of student.

Database for training the algorithm- 
MNIST Dataset- url-http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
Extracting images from the dataset- http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset

Detecting the traffic light is green or red.

Using OpenCV ibrary to make a mchine learning model to detect that the traffic light is green or red.

Problems:
First is to detect traffic light pole
Second is not to confuse between traffic light and car back light (which is also red)
Third is to see only the given direction traffic light and not other lights.
