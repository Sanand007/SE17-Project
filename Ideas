- Topic: Fake review detection
  Description: When you want to buy something online what is the main criteria that helps you toward making a decision to buy the product?
               Probably your answer is 'the reviews from previous customers'. 
               There is a lot of fake reviews on the internet which has been uploaded even from the manufacturer!
               So, to help the customer, there should be some way to exclude the fake reviews and purify the reviews. 
  Dataset: The Yelp review dataset

- Topic: Sentiment Analysis for Product Rating 
  Description: Costumers not only give from 1 to 5 stars to a product but also they write their views. 
               It is not quite fissible for a potential costumer to sit and read all the written reviews. 
               So, it would be beneficial if we can extract the key features of the product (pros and cons) from its previous costumers point of view and 
               show them to the potential costumer.
  
  
  
- Topic: Rating service providers from the costumers written reviews
  Description: This is somehow the same idea of the Sentiment analysis for product rating 
               but this time to extract the positive and negative experiance of the costumers about the service provider.
  
  
Handwriting Recognition System- Train a machine learning algorithm to convert any handwritten text into computerized text.
Users
Students- To convert any handwritten notes and use it for reading or storing. (Text takes much less space than scanned images)
TA/Prof- Assist in garding handwritten papers of student.
