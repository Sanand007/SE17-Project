- Topic: Fake review detection
  Description: When you want to buy something online what is the main criteria that helps you toward making a decision to buy the product?
               Probably your answer is 'the reviews from previous customers'. 
               There is a lot of fake reviews on the internet which has been uploaded even from the manufacturer!
               So, to help the customer, there should be some way to exclude the fake reviews and purify the reviews. 
  Dataset: The Yelp review dataset
  Seed paper: Michael Luca, Georgios Zervas (2016) Fake It Till You Make It: Reputation, Competition, and Yelp Review Fraud. Management
              Science 62(12):3412-3427. http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/mnsc.2015.2304

  
  
               
- Topic: Sentiment Analysis for Product Rating 
  Description: Costumers not only give from 1 to 5 stars to a product but also they write their views. 
               It is not quite fissible for a potential costumer to sit and read all the written reviews. 
               So, it would be beneficial if we can extract the key features of the product (pros and cons) from its previous costumers point of view and 
               show them to the potential costumer.
  
  
  
- Topic: Rating service providers from the costumers written reviews
  Description: This is somehow the same idea of the Sentiment analysis for product rating 
               but this time to extract the positive and negative experiance of the costumers about the service provider.

- Detecting the traffic light is green or red.
Using OpenCV ibrary to make a mchine learning model to detect that the traffic light is green or red.

Problems:
First is to detect traffic light pole
Second is not to confuse between traffic light and car back light (which is also red)
Third is to see only the given direction traffic light and not other lights.

Handwriting Recognition System- Train a machine learning algorithm to convert any handwritten text into computerized text.

Users
Students- To convert any handwritten notes and use it for reading or storing. (Text takes much less space than scanned images)
TA/Prof- Assist in garding handwritten papers of student.

Dataset for training the algorithm-

Advantages:
+Could find three different ways to implement pretty easily
Disadvantages:
-Might need background in psychology for effective implementation
-Need to learn how to program with the virtual reality headsets 

Smart Grid Technology: Lots going on in this field, still trying to pinpoint something we could work on for a project.
